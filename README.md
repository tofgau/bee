# bee
If you have a lot of batch or scripts running in a lot of places, you may ask yourself
- are they all running well
- where are they running ?

The idea of bee is to aggregatevthe state of all these task in a simple interface, as beeing able to send alarm if something that used to run do not gives any more news for a given time.
